-----

This project builds on the [Sunshine
app](https://www.github.com/udacity/Sunshine) with some additions:

- An update to the new Android material design
- A "smart" notification that may be able to inform the user of
  inclement weather conditions, or if the weather is predicted to change
  significantly during the day.
